# Reply on Mastodon for Micro.blog

## Overview

This Micro.blog plugin adds a button to your blog, allowing readers to reply to a post on Mastodon. When correctly integrated into your blog theme, it appears for posts that were cross-posted to Mastodon. For posts that weren't cross-posted, the button won't appear.

Once enabled, the plugin allows you to configure the button's title. By default, it displays "üêò Reply on Mastodon" because emojis are cool.
